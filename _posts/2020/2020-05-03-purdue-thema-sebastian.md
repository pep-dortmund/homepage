The following bachelor thesis discusses a thermal analysis of the support and
readout structure of Phase-2 pixel detectors from the *Inner Tracker* of the CMS
detector.
The structure is analyzed with a finite element analysis in ANSYS.
The model is simulated with different heat loads in the heat-generating parts
and the temperature distribution is discussed. Besides, there a
critical layer analysis on the different layers of the model is performed.
Criteria for the criticality of a material layer are derived and applied to the model.
The results show that the current detector design is sufficient to
achieve temperatures below {% latex %}-20\,^\circ\mathrm{C}{% endlatex %}.
