To further increase the accuracy and efficiency of the CMS Inner Tracker a new generation (Phase-2) of pixel sensors is required. However, new approaches must
first be validated on the current sensor generation (Phase-1) with test systems.

This bachelor thesis commissions such a laser-based test system, which can perform
the Alive and the S-curve test as well as the Trim calibrations. Furthermore,
the use of the laser enables the spatially resolved simulation of particle
radiation without exposing the sensor to high-energy radiation. With a sample
sensor and the software pxar the required functionalities are implemented, and
the focal point of the laser is determined.

During the analysis of the sample’s IV-characteristic, an unexpected hysteresis
was measured, most probably caused by thermal effects. Furthermore, examination
of the laser focal point with Gaussian optics yields a focal length of 
{% latex %} 9 \,\mathrm{mm} {% endlatex %}.
However, the determination of the focal length is limited by the pixel size and
charge sharing effects. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the setup can
perform tests and calibrations that could be used in the development process of
the next generation of pixel sensors. In addition, a future upgrade could offer
the possibility to test also manufactured Phase-2 pixel sensors.
